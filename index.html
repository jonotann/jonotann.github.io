            <p> I was introduced to computers at a very young age for my generation, tampering with hardware
                at the age of 5 I was able to absorb that information fairly quickly. My goal by the end of this
                class is to have the Web Development piece catching traction and eventually head into Mobile Software 
                development. A lot of people consider me determined, consistent and passionate about the things I have sought
                after in the past and I am confident that this adventure will be no different.
